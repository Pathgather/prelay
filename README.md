# Prelay

WIP mini-framework for defining logic to service Relay/GraphQL requests in a composable fashion.

Notes:
- Assumes MRI 2.3.0.
- Assumes the use of Sequel as a DB connection layer.
- Assumes the use of PostgreSQL, version 9.1+ (for window functions).
- Assumes the use of the 'graphql' and 'graphql-relay' gems.
- May be fundamentally misguided.
- All of the above may change at any time, without warning.
- Don't use.
