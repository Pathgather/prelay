Starter:

Base models/objects/whatever on datasets, not models?

Stop using model association hashes to track associations? Or set them, but
only in certain cases when we can be sure they're complete?





Minor stuff:

Add Prelay::ID.for().

Sequel associations with defined blocks (supported, need testing).

Refactor association column logic into local_column, remote_column (or something like that).

Cut down on retrieving key columns from the DB when it's not necessary.

Spec introspection query.

Spec custom dependent_columns.

Rename ASTs?

Come up with a better name than 'Model'. Also need a naming scheme.





Other Relay features to support:

Spec merging of repeat invocations of the same field/association, but nail
down what differences in arguments mean.





Associations:

Support associated :through, to allow GraphQL queries that skip the
intermediate associations. Should merge into other parts of the query that
query the intermediate association.

Figure out how to handle reciprocal associations.

If no columns are requested at an association level (will commonly be the case
when accessing :through associations), try to push that down to the DB as a
join. Maybe do that sometimes when columns are requested anyway.





Pagination:

Require a 'first' or 'last' argument on connections.

Support/spec pagination (via values, with cursors also encoding sort order)
and add sequel-seek-pagination as a dependency. Including
hasNextPage/hasPreviousPage. Make sure to add a spec for cursors/pageInfo in
fragments.

Support custom orders, and spec that they work with seek pagination.

Use a custom class for connection pagination logic.

Spec limited eager-loading via window functions.

Support counts on connections. Should respect arguments, and just return
counter caches when available and appropriate (no arguments). How should
counts change when paginating?

Support and spec aliased connections.





More:

Support marking attributes (and association fields) not-null.

Support descriptions on attributes.

Support deprecation warnings on fields (and whole objects?).

Freeze schema contents when they're generated.

Support some configurable way to reject queries that have the potential to
touch too many rows or generate queries of too severe complexity.

Query and Mutation classes.

Support top-level connection queries.

Give attributes dataset dependencies? Of which dependent_columns would just be
a special case?

Permissions: visibility both for whole rows and individual fields within rows.
May often need to modify queries to retrieve information to determine
visibility.

Add more checks that arguments are present and the right types.

Delete arguments as they're used, make sure there are none left at the end.
